## Overview

This sample project shows how to connect to multiple AI APIs — Gemini Live, OpenAI Realtime, Gemini image generation, OpenAI DALL-E, and Snap3D — using the Remote Service Gateway package in Lens Studio. It demonstrates real-time audio and video streaming to large language models, text-to-image generation, and text-to-3D generation with interactive results in the Spectacles environment. See more at the [Remote Service Gateway documentation](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/about-spectacles-features/overview).

> **NOTE**: This project will only work for the Spectacles platform. You must set the simulation mode in the Lens Studio Preview panel to `Spectacles (2024)`. You must also provide your own Remote Service Gateway Key to use the functionality provided by this project.

## Design Guidelines

Designing Lenses for Spectacles offers all-new possibilities to rethink user interaction with digital spaces and the physical world.
Get started using our [Design Guidelines](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/best-practices/design-for-spectacles/introduction-to-spatial-design)

## Prerequisites

- **Lens Studio**: v5.15.4+

**Note:** Ensure Lens Studio is [compatible with Spectacles](https://ar.snap.com/download) for your Spectacles device and OS versions.

- **Spectacles OS Version**: v5.64+
- **Spectacles App iOS**: v0.64+
- **Spectacles App Android**: v0.64+


To update your Spectacles device and mobile app, please refer to this [guide](https://support.spectacles.com/hc/en-us/articles/30214953982740-Updating).

You can download the latest version of Lens Studio from [here](https://ar.snap.com/download?lang=en-US).

The camera feature requires you to use Experimental APIs. Please see Experimental APIs for more details [here](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/about-spectacles-features/apis/experimental-apis).

## Getting Started

To obtain the project folder, clone the repository.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> This project uses Git Large Files Support (LFS). Downloading a zip file using the green button on GitHub **will not work**. You must clone the project with a version of git that has LFS.
> You can download Git LFS [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Initial Project Setup

The project should be pre-configured to get you started without any additional steps. However, if you encounter issues in the Logger Panel, please ensure your Lens Studio environment is set up for [Spectacles](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/get-started/start-buiding/preview-panel).

To enable AI features, you must provide a Remote Service Gateway token:

1. Install the Remote Service Gateway Token Generator plug-in from the Asset Browser.
2. Go to **Window > Remote Service Gateway Token**.
3. Click **Generate Token**.
4. Copy and paste the token into the `RemoteServiceGatewayCredentials` object in the Inspector.

## Key Script

[AIAssistantUIBridge.ts](./Assets/Scripts/AIAssistantUIBridge.ts) - Connects AI assistants (Gemini Live and OpenAI Realtime) to the Sphere Controller UI and the Snap3D factory.

[GeminiAssistant.ts](./Assets/Scripts/GeminiAssistant.ts) - Manages the Gemini Live WebSocket session, streaming audio and video input and handling text or function call responses.

[OpenAIAssistant.ts](./Assets/Scripts/OpenAIAssistant.ts) - Manages the OpenAI Realtime WebSocket session, handling audio streaming, text responses, and function calls with call ID tracking.

[ImageGenerator.ts](./Assets/Scripts/ImageGenerator.ts) - Wraps the Gemini and OpenAI image generation APIs to return a Texture promise from a text prompt.

[InteractableImageGenerator.ts](./Assets/Scripts/InteractableImageGenerator.ts) - Connects ASR voice queries to the ImageGenerator and displays the resulting image on screen.

[InteractableSnap3DGenerator.ts](./Assets/Scripts/InteractableSnap3DGenerator.ts) - Connects ASR voice queries to the Snap3D factory to generate 3D objects at a target scene position.

[Snap3DInteractableFactory.ts](./Assets/Scripts/Snap3DInteractableFactory.ts) - Creates interactable Snap3D scene objects from text prompts and manages the full generation lifecycle.

[Snap3DInteractable.ts](./Assets/Scripts/Snap3DInteractable.ts) - Receives image preview and final mesh data from the factory and renders them on an interactable scene object.

[ASRQueryController.ts](./Assets/Scripts/ASRQueryController.ts) - Implements a single-query voice button using ASR that fires an event with the transcribed text on completion.

[SphereController.ts](./Assets/Scripts/SphereController.ts) - Manages the orb UI element that follows the user's hand, can be placed in world space, and falls back to screen space when out of view.

[InternetAvailabilityPopUp.ts](./Assets/Scripts/InternetAvailabilityPopUp.ts) - Shows or animates away a popup to inform the user when internet connectivity is unavailable.

[APIKeyHint.ts](./Assets/Scripts/APIKeyHint.ts) - Displays a hint message when any required API key has not been configured in the Remote Service Gateway Credentials component.

## Testing the Lens

### In Lens Studio Editor

1. Open the Preview panel in Lens Studio and set the simulation mode to `Spectacles (2024)`.
2. Ensure your Remote Service Gateway token is correctly set in the `RemoteServiceGatewayCredentials` object.
3. Select either the **Gemini Live** or **OpenAI Realtime** button in the preview to start a session.
4. Use the on-screen orb to activate and deactivate the microphone input to the assistant.

### In Spectacles Device

1. Build and deploy the project to your Spectacles device.
2. Follow the [Spectacles guide](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/get-started/start-building/preview-panel) for device testing.
3. Look down at your left hand and pinch the orb to activate the AI assistant.
4. Speak a prompt — the assistant will respond with voice and text output.
