## Overview

Spectacles Mobile Kit is a SDK that enables seamless communication between mobile applications and Lenses running on Spectacles via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This sample demonstrates how to establish a secure session, send one-way data, perform request-response exchanges, subscribe to topics, and load remote textures and meshes from a companion mobile app. Learn more about the Spectacles Mobile Kit in the [official documentation](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/spectacles-frameworks/spectacles-mobile-kit/getting-started).

## Design Guidelines

Designing Lenses for Spectacles offers all-new possibilities to rethink user interaction with digital spaces and the physical world.
Get started using our [Design Guidelines](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/best-practices/design-for-spectacles/introduction-to-spatial-design)

## Prerequisites

- **Lens Studio**: v5.15.4+

**Note:** Ensure Lens Studio is [compatible with Spectacles](https://ar.snap.com/download) for your Spectacles device and OS versions.

- **Spectacles OS Version**: v5.64+
- **Spectacles App iOS**: v0.64+
- **Spectacles App Android**: v0.64+


To update your Spectacles device and mobile app, please refer to this [guide](https://support.spectacles.com/hc/en-us/articles/30214953982740-Updating).

You can download the latest version of Lens Studio from [here](https://ar.snap.com/download?lang=en-US).

## Getting Started

To obtain the project folder, clone the repository.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> This project uses Git Large Files Support (LFS). Downloading a zip file using the green button on GitHub **will not work**. You must clone the project with a version of git that has LFS.
> You can download Git LFS [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Initial Project Setup

The project should be pre-configured to get you started without any additional steps. However, if you encounter issues in the Logger Panel, please ensure your Lens Studio environment is set up for [Spectacles](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/get-started/start-buiding/preview-panel).

Before running the sample, you will also need a companion mobile app for bonding and session management:

- **iOS**: Open [app/iOS/SpectaclesKitSample/](app/iOS/SpectaclesKitSample/) in Xcode 16 and run on a physical iPhone.
- **Android**: Import [app/Android/SpectaclesKitSample/](app/Android/SpectaclesKitSample/) in Android Studio and run on a physical device.

The bonding flow must be completed once via the Spectacles App before a session can be established.

## Key Script

[SpectaclesMobileKitTest_TS.ts](./Assets/Scripts/SpectaclesMobileKitTest_TS.ts) - Drives the full Mobile Kit demo: creates a BLE session with the companion app, performs one-way data send, request-response exchanges, topic subscriptions, and remote texture/mesh loading via the Internet and RemoteMedia modules.

## Testing the Lens

### In Lens Studio Editor

1. Open [SpectaclesMobileKit.esproj](SpectaclesMobileKit.esproj) in Lens Studio.
2. Go to **Project Settings** and verify the Lens Name is set to `MobileKitTest`.
3. Open the **Preview Panel** and select the Spectacles preview mode.
4. Review the Logger Panel for connection status and any errors.

> **NOTE**: This project will only work for the Spectacles platform.

### In Spectacles Device

1. Click **Preview Lens** in Lens Studio to install and launch the Lens on your Spectacles.
2. Launch the companion mobile app on your phone:
   - **iOS**: Tap **SpectaclesKit bind**, grant Bluetooth access, approve the bond in the Spectacles App, then tap **Start Session**.
   - **Android**: Tap the **+** button, approve permissions and the bond in the Spectacles App — the app connects automatically.
3. Once connected, the Lens displays the session status, loads a remote image and mesh, and shows subscription responses from the mobile app.
4. If `Reset After Delay` is enabled, the session closes automatically after 10 seconds.
