## Overview

This project showcases a real-time collaborative AR experience on Connected Lenses: **UIKit** RGB sliders, a shared **TextInputField**, and a **RectangleButton** stay in sync for every user via a single `GeneralDataStore`. RGB values still drive the color of the scene object. All interactions are mirrored across devices.
This lens leverages the [Spectacles Interaction Kit (SIK)](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/spectacles-frameworks/spectacles-interaction-kit/get-started) to simplify UI development for Spectacles and demonstrates the potential of [Connected Lenses](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/about-spectacles-features/connected-lenses/overview) for creating engaging, synchronized AR experiences.

> **NOTE**: This project will only work for the Spectacles platform.

## Design Guidelines

Designing Lenses for Spectacles offers all-new possibilities to rethink user interaction with digital spaces and the physical world.
Get started using our [Design Guidelines](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/best-practices/design-for-spectacles/introduction-to-spatial-design)

## Prerequisites

- **Lens Studio**: v5.15.4+

**Note:** Ensure Lens Studio is [compatible with Spectacles](https://ar.snap.com/download) for your Spectacles device and OS versions.

- **Spectacles OS Version**: v5.64+
- **Spectacles App iOS**: v0.64+
- **Spectacles App Android**: v0.64+


To update your Spectacles device and mobile app, please refer to this [guide](https://support.spectacles.com/hc/en-us/articles/30214953982740-Updating).

You can download the latest version of Lens Studio from [here](https://ar.snap.com/download?lang=en-US).

## Getting Started

To obtain the project folder, clone the repository.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> This project uses Git Large Files Support (LFS). Downloading a zip file using the green button on GitHub **will not work**. You must clone the project with a version of git that has LFS.
> You can download Git LFS [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Initial Project Setup

The project should be pre-configured to get you started without any additional steps. However, if you encounter issues in the Logger Panel, please ensure your Lens Studio environment is set up for [Spectacles](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/get-started/start-buiding/preview-panel).

## Key Script

[UIKitSyncManager.ts](./Assets/Scripts/UIKitSyncManager.ts) - Single component that joins or creates a shared `GeneralDataStore`, binds **Spectacles UIKit** `Slider`, `TextInputField`, and `RectangleButton` inputs to store keys, and applies synced RGB values to the target material so every user sees the same UI and object color in real time.

## Testing the Lens

### In Lens Studio Editor

1. Open the Lens in Lens Studio and create two Interactive Previews using the [Interactive Preview Panel](https://developers.snap.com/lens-studio/lens-studio-workflow/previewing-your-lens#interactive-preview).
2. Click the Multiplayer button for both previews. They will connect to the same session and map surroundings automatically.
3. Test functionality:
   - Adjust the RGB sliders in one preview and confirm the floating object's color updates in both previews in real time.
   - Edit the shared text field or tap the synced button in one preview and confirm the other preview updates to match.

### In Spectacles Device

1. Connect two pairs of Spectacles to the same session following the [Playing Connected Lenses Guide](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/about-spectacles-features/connected-lenses/overview#playing-connected-lenses-on-spectacles).
2. Test functionality:
   - Use the RGB sliders on one device and ensure the floating object's color updates in real time on both devices.
   - Change the shared text field or button on one device and confirm the other device stays in sync.
