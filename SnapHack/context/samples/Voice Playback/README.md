## Overview

This sample project demonstrates how to record audio from the microphone of Spectacles and play it back. Once the Lens is closed, the recordings you have made are no longer available. For more details on microphone access and audio features, refer to the [Lens Studio Audio documentation](https://developers.snap.com/lens-studio/features/audio/playing-audio).

> **NOTE**: This project will only work for the Spectacles platform.

## Initial Project Setup

The project should be pre-configured to get you started without any additional steps. However, if you encounter issues in the Logger Panel, please ensure your Lens Studio environment is set up for [Spectacles](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/get-started/start-buiding/preview-panel).

## Key Script

[MicrophoneRecorder.ts](./Assets/Scripts/MicrophoneRecorder.ts) - Controls the logic for recording microphone input, storing it locally to the device, and playing back the recorded audio.

[ActivateMicrophoneRecorder.ts](./Assets/Scripts/ActivateMicrophoneRecorder.ts) - UI helper that listens for button press and release events to start and stop microphone recording.

[PlaybackMicrophoneRecorder.ts](./Assets/Scripts/PlaybackMicrophoneRecorder.ts) - UI helper that listens for button press events to trigger playback of the recorded audio.

## Testing the Lens

### In Lens Studio Editor

Make sure that you have enabled the live microphone input so that Lens Studio can get microphone data.

Once the Live Microphone Input is enabled, you can press and hold the "Record" button. The duration of the microphone recording is determined by how long you hold this button.

> **Warning:** Please be mindful of the size of the recording.

After you finish recording, press the "Playback" button once. If you have recorded audio, you can press this button as many times as you want to replay the recording.

### In Spectacles Device

Use your right or left hand to pinch the "Record" button. Hold your pinch as long as you want to record.

Press the "Playback" button once you have recorded to get the audio playback.

The UI elements are under a Container Frame so you can move the UI frame as you like.
