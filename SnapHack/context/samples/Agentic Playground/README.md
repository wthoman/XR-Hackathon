> **NOTE:**
> This project will only work for the **Spectacles platform**. You must set the simulation mode in Lens Studio Preview to `Spectacles (2024)`.
> You must also provide your own **Remote Service Gateway API Token** to use the AI functionality provided by this project.

## Overview

Agentic Playground is an AI-powered educational assistant for Snap Spectacles that demonstrates a full agentic architecture using real-time speech processing, intelligent tool routing, and multi-modal content generation. Students can ask questions, receive lecture summaries, generate visual diagrams, and explore their environment — all through natural voice interaction. The system uses AI reasoning (not hard-coded rules) to route queries to specialized tools. Learn more about building with AI on Spectacles at the [Spectacles Developer Portal](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles).

## Design Guidelines

Designing Lenses for Spectacles offers all-new possibilities to rethink user interaction with digital spaces and the physical world.
Get started using our [Design Guidelines](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/best-practices/design-for-spectacles/introduction-to-spatial-design)

## Prerequisites

- **Lens Studio**: v5.15.4+

**Note:** Ensure Lens Studio is [compatible with Spectacles](https://ar.snap.com/download) for your Spectacles device and OS versions.

- **Spectacles OS Version**: v5.64+
- **Spectacles App iOS**: v0.64+
- **Spectacles App Android**: v0.64+


To update your Spectacles device and mobile app, please refer to this [guide](https://support.spectacles.com/hc/en-us/articles/30214953982740-Updating).

You can download the latest version of Lens Studio from [here](https://ar.snap.com/download?lang=en-US).

## Getting Started

To obtain the project folder, clone the repository.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> This project uses Git Large Files Support (LFS). Downloading a zip file using the green button on GitHub **will not work**. You must clone the project with a version of git that has LFS.
> You can download Git LFS [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Initial Project Setup

The project should be pre-configured to get you started without any additional steps. However, if you encounter issues in the Logger Panel, please ensure your Lens Studio environment is set up for [Spectacles](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/get-started/start-buiding/preview-panel).

### Remote Service Gateway Token

This project requires a Remote Service Gateway API token to access AI services:

1. Install the **Remote Service Gateway Token Generator** from the Asset Library (Spectacles section)
2. Open: **Windows** > **Remote Service Gateway Token**
3. Click **Generate Token** and copy the generated token
4. Locate `RemoteServiceGatewayCredentials` in your scene and paste the token in the Inspector

The token enables access to OpenAI (Chat, Realtime API, Image Generation), Gemini (Live API with vision), and Snap3D (text-to-3D model generation).

## Key Scripts

[AgentOrchestrator.ts](./Assets/Scripts/Agents/AgentOrchestrator.ts) - Central coordinator that manages the entire agentic flow, receives transcribed queries from the ASR layer, delegates to the ToolRouter, and updates the UI with voice and visual responses.

[ToolRouter.ts](./Assets/Scripts/Tools/ToolRouter.ts) - AI-powered tool selector that analyzes user intent using an LLM (no hard-coded rules) and dispatches to the appropriate specialized tool: GeneralConversationTool, SummaryTool, SpatialTool, DiagramCreatorTool, or DiagramUpdaterTool.

[AgentLanguageInterface.ts](./Assets/Scripts/Agents/AgentLanguageInterface.ts) - Unified abstraction layer over OpenAI and Gemini providers, handling provider switching, text generation, and voice output coordination.

[AISummarizer.ts](./Assets/Scripts/Core/AISummarizer.ts) - Converts raw lecture transcriptions into structured JSON summary cards with strict character limits optimized for AR card display.

[ChatASRController.ts](./Assets/Scripts/ASR/ChatASRController.ts) - Handles turn-based voice input transcription for the conversational chat interface.

[SummaryASRController.ts](./Assets/Scripts/ASR/SummaryASRController.ts) - Continuously captures and transcribes lecture audio, accumulating content for summarization.

## Testing the Lens

### In Lens Studio Editor

1. Open the Preview panel in Lens Studio
2. Set **Device Type Override** to `Spectacles (2024)`
3. Ensure your Remote Service Gateway API token is correctly configured in `RemoteServiceGatewayCredentials`
4. Use headphones to prevent audio feedback during voice testing
5. Enable `testMode` on `SummaryComponent` or `ChatComponent` to test with mock educational data without a live lecture

### In Spectacles Device

1. Build and deploy the project to your Spectacles device
2. Follow the [Spectacles deployment guide](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/get-started/start-building/preview-panel) for device testing
3. Ensure internet connectivity for AI API access
4. Speak naturally to trigger the chat interface — the AI will route your query to the appropriate tool automatically
5. The spatial tool activates when you ask about what you see in your environment (uses the camera)
