## Overview

Spatial Image Gallery demonstrates how to upload a flat photo and receive a 3D spatialized mesh using the Snap Spatial Image API. The sample showcases depth animation, angle-based depth flattening, and multi-image gallery navigation using the Spectacles Interaction Kit. Viewing angle is continuously monitored so the image flattens gracefully when observed from extreme perspectives. Learn more about Spatial Images in the [Snap developer docs](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/about-spectacles-features/apis/spatial-image).

> **NOTE**: This project will only work for the Spectacles platform.

## Design Guidelines

Designing Lenses for Spectacles offers all-new possibilities to rethink user interaction with digital spaces and the physical world.
Get started using our [Design Guidelines](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/best-practices/design-for-spectacles/introduction-to-spatial-design)

## Prerequisites

- **Lens Studio**: v5.15.4+

**Note:** Ensure Lens Studio is [compatible with Spectacles](https://ar.snap.com/download) for your Spectacles device and OS versions.

- **Spectacles OS Version**: v5.64+
- **Spectacles App iOS**: v0.64+
- **Spectacles App Android**: v0.64+


To update your Spectacles device and mobile app, please refer to this [guide](https://support.spectacles.com/hc/en-us/articles/30214953982740-Updating).

You can download the latest version of Lens Studio from [here](https://ar.snap.com/download?lang=en-US).

## Getting Started

To obtain the project folder, clone the repository.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> This project uses Git Large Files Support (LFS). Downloading a zip file using the green button on GitHub **will not work**. You must clone the project with a version of git that has LFS.
> You can download Git LFS [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Initial Project Setup

The project should be pre-configured to get you started without any additional steps. However, if you encounter issues in the Logger Panel, please ensure your Lens Studio environment is set up for [Spectacles](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/get-started/start-buiding/preview-panel).

> **Remote Service Gateway**
> To access the spatialization service, a gateway credential is required. Follow the instructions [here](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/about-spectacles-features/apis/remoteservice-gateway) to obtain a credential and enter it in the **RemoteServiceGatewayCredentials** SceneObject.

## Key Script

[SpatialGallery.ts](./Assets/Scripts/SpatialGallery.ts) - Drives gallery navigation, wires up the loading indicator, and calls `setImage` on the frame when the user pages through images.

[SpatialImageFrame.ts](./Assets/Scripts/SpatialImageFrame.ts) - Acts as the central manager, sizing the SIK ContainerFrame to match each image's aspect ratio and coordinating the spatializer, swapper, and focal-point tracking.

[SpatialImageSwapper.ts](./Assets/Scripts/SpatialImageSwapper.ts) - Handles the visual swap between the flat placeholder image and the returned spatialized mesh once loading completes.

[SpatialImageDepthAnimator.ts](./Assets/Scripts/SpatialImageDepthAnimator.ts) - Animates the depth scale of the spatialized image, easing it in on load and flattening it when the viewing angle becomes invalid.

[SpatialImageAngleValidator.ts](./Assets/Scripts/SpatialImageAngleValidator.ts) - Continuously measures the camera angle relative to the image and fires callbacks when the user enters or exits the valid viewing zone.

## Testing the Lens

### In Lens Studio Editor

1. Open the project in Lens Studio and ensure the **RemoteServiceGatewayCredentials** SceneObject has a valid API token.
2. Select the **Preview** panel and set the device type to Spectacles.
3. Press **Play** — the first image in the gallery will be spatialized and the depth effect will animate in.
4. Use the left and right pinch buttons in the scene to navigate between gallery images and observe the loading indicator while each image is being processed.

### In Spectacles Device

1. Push the Lens to your Spectacles using the Lens Studio push workflow.
2. Ensure your device has an active internet connection so the spatialization service can be reached.
3. Launch the Lens and wait for the first image to spatialize — the flat placeholder will be replaced by the 3D mesh.
4. Pinch the left or right navigation buttons to browse the gallery, and physically move your head to observe the angle-based depth flattening.
