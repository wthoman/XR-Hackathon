# Character Controller

The Character Controller Component is a modular, customizable movement system designed to support various gameplay
formats, including third-person, first-person, side-scroller, and top-down perspectives. It provides a non-physics-based
movement model with optional physics interactions, allowing for smooth, responsive controls without physics body
dependencies.

## Usage

1. Add to a scene and add Bitmoji 3D component on the same SceneObject as Character Controller.
2. Enable Adapt to Mixamo for Bitmoji 3D.
3. Select Tracking camera for Input Control Type Joystick (camera which render character controller).

All updates to character controller (for example, calling move API) and environment (for example, moving colliders, etc)
should be performed on UpdateEvent, not LateUpdateEvent.

Character's scale and position will not be changed in runtime by updating Transform, in order to change its position
please use setPosition API.
